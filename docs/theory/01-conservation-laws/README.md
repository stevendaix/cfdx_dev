# Conservation Laws

**Status: TOPO — detailed course chapter not yet migrated.**

## Planned course
1. Reynolds transport theorem
2. Mass conservation
3. Momentum conservation
4. Total and internal energy
5. Scalar/species transport
6. Source terms
7. Conservative and non-conservative forms
8. Boundary fluxes
9. Dimensional analysis
10. Finite-volume conservation requirements

## Verification
Integral balances, manufactured source terms and internal face-flux antisymmetry.

## Scientific explanation standard

This chapter is part of the CFDX Theory course. A short descriptive statement or comparison table is not sufficient for a major numerical or physical method.

For every important equation or method, the final documentation must follow this chain:

$$
\boxed{
\text{motivation}
\rightarrow
\text{definitions}
\rightarrow
\text{derivation}
\rightarrow
\text{FVM/discretisation}
\rightarrow
\text{CFDX algorithm}
\rightarrow
\text{example}
\rightarrow
\text{error/limitations}
\rightarrow
\text{tests}
\rightarrow
\text{benchmark/V\&V}
\rightarrow
\text{bibliography}
}
$$

### Required explanation

1. Explain why the equation or method is needed and what physical/mathematical problem it solves.
2. Define every symbol, tensor/vector/scalar, unit and sign convention.
3. Derive the formula sufficiently for a reader to reproduce the result.
4. Show the finite-volume or discrete transformation where applicable.
5. Explain the actual CFDX computational sequence, not only the textbook algorithm.
6. Give a small analytical, manufactured-solution or numerical example whenever meaningful.
7. Explain truncation error, consistency, stability, conditioning, boundedness, conservation and sensitivity as applicable.
8. Identify the exact implementation files and the data passed between stages.
9. Link the mathematical property to executable verification tests.
10. Identify the benchmark and V&V evidence, including scope and limitations.
11. Cite the scientific literature and record stable bibliographic identifiers in the project bibliography.

Comparison tables remain useful, but they are summaries **after** the mathematical explanation and never substitutes for it.

### Evidence vocabulary

- **Implemented** — an executable code path exists.
- **Verified** — a defined mathematical/software property has executable evidence.
- **Validated** — comparison exists against an independent physical or trusted reference.
- **Qualified** — the declared capability is demonstrated over an explicit scope.

A chapter may be scientifically complete while a capability remains unqualified. Documentation must never promote numerical maturity.
